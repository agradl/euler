## Running a single problem
`dotnet run #` to run problem #

## Running all problems
`dotnet run` to run all problems solved

Once a problem has been solved and the CorrectAnswer property is overriden with the correct value, it is safe to refactor since the returned value will be validated against the CorrectAnswer property
